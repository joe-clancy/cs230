Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room is a game development company who wants to develop a web-based game that serves multiple platforms based on their current game Draw It or Lose It, but lacks the expertise to implement it.  Draw It or Lose It is currently only available as an Android app.  The game will allow multiple unique games, each with multiple unique teams, each with multiple unique players.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I felt that my recommendations for system architectures were thorough and well considered.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

The UML Class diagram was extremely helpful in writing the code, and I refereneced it directly through the entire process.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

While the evaluation section was adequate, I felt that the table format limited the scope of the comparative information.  I think a paragraph format would allow for a more thorough comparison.  I think I could also improve this section with specific pricing comparisons for OS and software licenses, as well as estimates for hosting costs.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I interpreted the user's needs by carefully reviewing the requirements for each section of the project while implementing them and then testing the output to ensure it matched the specified requirements.  It is important to consider user's needs when designing because the user's needs essentially represent the entire point of the software.  Failing to satisfy the user's needs will result in an unsuccessful piece of software, even if it is technically compliant.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

Implementing role-based authentication using security tokens is a technique I expect to employ again in the future for any application that relies on a RESTful API.
